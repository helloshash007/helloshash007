You can enhance your Confluence document with additional details and a flow diagram. Here's an improved structure:

Automated Deployment of IKP Microservices Using Jenkins, Ansible & Shell Script

1. Overview

This document provides a detailed workflow of how Jenkins, Ansible, and Shell scripts are used to automate the deployment of IKP microservices across environments.

2. Deployment Flow Diagram

(A flow diagram showcasing the end-to-end process from code commit to production deployment.)

Flow Steps:

1. Code Commit & Push → Developer pushes code to Git repository.


2. Jenkins Trigger → Jenkins detects changes and starts the pipeline.


3. Version Check & Git Change Recording → Logs commit ID and branch details.


4. Artifact Retrieval → Fetches the correct package from Nexus Docker registry.


5. Pre-Deployment Checks → Validates system resources, configurations, and existing versions.


6. Ansible Deployment → Ansible playbook deploys the microservice.


7. Post-Deployment Validation → Health check APIs confirm service is running.


8. Logging & Notifications → Deployment status is recorded and shared.

3. Detailed Deployment Steps

Step 1: Jenkins Pipeline Execution

Jenkins pipeline is manually triggered or automatically starts on a Git push.

Captures parameters like:

Git branch

Application version

Target environment



Step 2: Version Control & Change Management

Git commit ID and branch name are logged.

Change history is recorded in a dedicated tracking system.


Step 3: Fetching Artifacts from Nexus

Retrieves the correct version of the microservice Docker image.

Ensures checksum verification for integrity.


Step 4: Pre-Deployment Validation

Ansible checks if a previous version is running.

Validates system resource availability (CPU, memory).

Ensures required configurations are in place.


Step 5: Deployment with Ansible

Pulls the Docker image from Nexus.

Updates configuration files if necessary.

Starts the new service instance.


Step 6: Post-Deployment Health Checks

Calls the microservice health API to ensure successful deployment.

Logs deployment status in Confluence or a monitoring tool.


Step 7: Notification & Logging

Sends deployment notifications via Slack or email.

Records all details (commit ID, package version, environment, etc.).

4. Key Features & Benefits

✅ End-to-End Traceability: Git commit linked to deployment history.
✅ Automated Artifact Management: Verified package retrieval from Nexus.
✅ Pre & Post Checks: Ensures zero-downtime deployments.
✅ Fully Automated: Reduces manual intervention and errors.

5. Flow Diagram

To add a flow diagram in Confluence:

Use the draw.io plugin in Confluence.

OR create a Visio/Lucidchart diagram and embed it.

OR draw using PlantUML in Confluence (for text-based diagrams).
