Perfect 👍 — you want to build the monitoring dashboard in React, not just reuse Grafana, and then justify why your React-based solution is better. Let’s approach this step by step:

🚀 Why Build Postgres Monitoring Dashboard in React?

Grafana is great, but it’s generic. A React-based dashboard lets you:

1. Custom UX/UI

Tailor dashboards to your team’s workflows (DBA vs DevOps vs App teams).

Build intuitive layouts (cards, drill-downs, heatmaps) instead of rigid Grafana panels.



2. Interactive Controls

Filters for schema, user, query type.

On-click drill-down (e.g., click a slow query → view execution plan → suggest indexes).

Interactive trend zooming with D3/Recharts.



3. Integration Flexibility

Fetch metrics from multiple sources: Prometheus, Postgres system views (pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_statements), logs (ELK), CloudWatch.

Can merge DB metrics with business metrics (e.g., transactions/sec tied to customer actions).



4. Advanced Visuals

Heatmaps, timelines, topology maps (for replication).

Color-coded warnings with React animations.

Combine metrics + logs in a single widget (Grafana usually splits them).



5. Custom Alerting & AI

Integrate ML models (TensorFlow.js or API) to detect anomalies.

Forecast storage/connection saturation visually.

Intelligent recommendations (e.g., “VACUUM needed on schema.orders”).



6. Scalability & Extensibility

Add new modules (capacity planning, compliance checks, SLA reports) without Grafana plugin restrictions.

White-label for different teams/products.

🔄 React Dashboard vs Grafana: Value Proposition

Feature	Grafana	React-based Dashboard

UI/UX	Fixed panel-driven UI	Fully customizable UI/UX with React components
Query Drilldown	Needs plugins/SQL panels	Built-in custom drilldowns (e.g., query → execution plan → index advice)
Business Metric Mapping	Harder (needs multiple datasources/plugins)	Can directly merge DB + business KPIs in same chart
Integration	Mostly metric-oriented (Prometheus, Influx, etc.)	Can combine metrics, logs, APIs, custom ML models
Customization	Limited to plugins/dashboards	Unlimited flexibility with React libraries (Recharts, D3, Victory)
Alerting	Standard threshold-based	Predictive, AI-driven alerts (custom logic)
Branding/Ownership	Grafana branding, plugin ecosystem	In-house branding, extensible product roadmap
Cost	Free OSS, but plugins & Grafana Enterprise cost extra	Development effort upfront, but full control long term

📊 Example React Dashboard Blueprint

Your React app could have 4 main modules:

1. Database Health

Active/idle connections (gauge)

CPU/memory/disk usage (line charts)

WAL & replication lag (time series)



2. Query Performance

Top N slow queries (table with drill-down)

Heatmap of query execution times

Sequential scans vs index scans trend



3. Locks & Blocking

Active blocking sessions (table)

Lock tree visualization (React flow diagram)



4. Capacity & Forecasting

DB size growth trend with forecast line

Storage usage projection (next 30 days)

Autovacuum effectiveness over time

🎯 How to Prove It’s Better than Grafana

When you present your solution, focus on value add:

Tailored DBA Experience – Show a query drilldown flow that Grafana can’t do without plugins.

Business + DB Integration – Show a chart correlating “Payment Failures” with “DB Lock Waits.” Grafana can’t do this natively.

Predictive Analytics – Highlight forecasting graphs (connections will saturate in 12 days at current growth).

Interactive Controls – Filters, search bars, and drilldowns (not static like Grafana dashboards).

Cost Justification – Grafana Enterprise = $$$. React solution = one-time dev effort + open-source libs.

Flexibility – React = extend with ML/AI, audit compliance, user management, etc. Grafana = plugins, limited scope.

⚡ Recommendation: You should position Grafana as good for infra monitoring, while your React dashboard is Postgres-specialized, predictive, and business-aware.

👉 Shashank, do you want me to sketch out a React component structure (which components you’ll need, how to fetch data, and how to layout the UI)? That way, you’ll have a starting point for actual implementation.



Got it ✅. You want to design a Postgres monitoring dashboard that goes beyond AppDynamics (AppD) and demonstrates clear value. Let’s break this into key pointers, benefits, and AppD comparison so you can position your work strongly.

🔑 Key Pointers for a Powerful Postgres Monitoring Dashboard

1. Core Database Health Metrics

Connections

Active, idle, idle in transaction

Connection pool usage vs limits


Locks & Blocking

Queries causing blocking/deadlocks

Lock wait time trends


Replication & High Availability

Replication lag

WAL write/flush/replication stats

Failover readiness checks


Resource Utilization

Buffer cache hit ratio

Checkpoints, bgwriter activity

Temp file usage (indicates memory pressure)


Query Performance

Slow queries (pg_stat_statements)

Top queries by execution time, I/O, CPU

Query plans (detect bad indexes, sequential scans)



2. Performance & Scalability Metrics

Throughput

TPS (transactions per second)

Commit/rollback ratio


I/O

Reads/writes per second

Index vs seq scan ratio

Table bloat, vacuum/analyze status


Autovacuum Efficiency

Queued/autovacuum workers

Dead tuple % per table



3. System Level (beyond DB)

CPU, Memory, Disk IOPS, Network throughput (for correlation)

OS-level wait events (I/O waits, CPU steal time)

Integration with pg_stat_activity, pg_stat_bgwriter, pg_stat_io


4. Advanced Insights

Alerting & Anomaly Detection

Predictive alerts for connection saturation, replication lag, disk usage


Business KPIs

Map DB performance to business events (e.g., user login queries, payments table TPS)


Historical Trends

1h, 1d, 1w, 1m performance comparison

Growth trends in DB size, index size, WAL logs



5. Visualization Ideas

Heatmaps for query wait times

Top 10 queries by resource consumption

Replication lag over time line chart

Connection pool gauge with thresholds

Storage growth forecast graphs

🎯 Benefits of a Custom Dashboard

1. Database-Specific Focus – Unlike AppD (which is application-centric), you can tailor dashboards to Postgres internals.


2. Granular Query Visibility – Directly leverage pg_stat_statements, query plans, bloat reports.


3. Predictive Capacity Planning – Forecast storage, connections, and performance issues proactively.


4. Operational Insights – Highlight maintenance issues (vacuum, bloat, autovacuum inefficiency) which AppD doesn’t track deeply.


5. Flexibility – You choose KPIs, visualization tools (Grafana, Prometheus, ELK, etc.), and integrate logs + metrics.


6. Cost Efficiency – Open-source stack (Prometheus + Grafana + exporters) often cheaper than AppD licensing.

🔄 Advantages Over AppDynamics

Feature	AppDynamics	Custom Dashboard (Prometheus/Grafana etc.)

Depth of DB Metrics	Limited (focus on high-level DB health, waits, some queries)	Full Postgres internals: locks, replication, bloat, vacuum, pg_stat_statements
Query Analysis	Limited	Deep analysis with top queries, execution plans
Cost	High licensing	Free/open-source stack
Customization	Predefined templates, less flexible	Fully customizable KPIs, visualizations
Integration	Strong app ↔ infra correlation	Strong DB internals, can still integrate with infra monitoring
Alerting	App-centric	DB-centric, predictive, anomaly detection
Scalability	Works well for enterprise apps	Scales to large Postgres clusters with exporters



---

📌 Suggested Stack

Prometheus – scrape metrics via postgres_exporter

Grafana – dashboard visualization

PgBouncer exporter – connection pooling stats

Node Exporter – OS metrics

pgBadger or pg_stat_statements – query analysis

Alertmanager – proactive notifications

👉 Shashank, if you want, I can draft a sample Grafana dashboard layout (sections, graphs, tables, KPIs) so you can propose a concrete design to your team.

Would you like me to create that dashboard blueprint for you?
