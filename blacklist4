Utility Development and Production Deployment Success

I led the design and development of a critical utility aimed at optimizing operations for a vendor-owned application, delivering a cost saving of approximately $30,000 USD annually. This initiative required close collaboration with both the application vendor and business stakeholders to ensure compliance, technical alignment, and approval for production deployment.

Despite the vendor's initial estimation of 6 months for implementation, we successfully delivered and tested the utility across multiple platforms in just 3 weeks, showcasing our team's agility and cross-functional coordination. This was achieved without impacting our pre-defined deliverables, through effective task prioritization and clear communication.

The utility is now live in production, bringing measurable cost efficiencies and strengthening our working relationship with the vendor and business teams.
